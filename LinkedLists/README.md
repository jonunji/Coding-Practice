# Linked Lists
A linked list allows us to store data in a linear path.

A linked list in summary:
* Cannot access elements at random
* Must traverse one element at a time
* This implementation includes a head AND tail pointer
* Nodes are NOT stored in contiguous memory

Linked lists look something like this:

[1] -> [2] -> [3] -> [4]

Compare to an array, which would look something like this:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
